### Thrid-Party Libraries

- me.tatarka.bindingcollectionadapter2:bindingcollectionadapter
- me.tatarka.bindingcollectionadapter2:bindingcollectionadapter-recyclerview

Those two libiaries (under Apache License, can be found at https://github.com/evant/binding-collection-adapter) were used to support the `DataBinding` from `ViewModel` with `ObservableField` to `RecyclerView` with collection of views, therefore possible to apply `MVVM` pattern in this coursework.
